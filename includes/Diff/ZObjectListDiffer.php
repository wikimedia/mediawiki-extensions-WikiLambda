		 * If we want to find position changes and flag them as such, we
		 * should calculate the edit matrix also when the count of elements
		 * is the same in $newArray and $oldArray.
		 *
		 * This would give us some matrix edit count like the following:
		 *
		 * | 0 1 1 |
		 * | 1 1 0 |
		 * | 1 0 1 |
		 *
		 * Where the zero edits are not in the matrix diagonal. This would
		 * probably flag a couple of indexChange edits such as:
		 *
		 * [ list.1, indexChange, [1, 2] ]
		 * [ list.2, indexChange, [2, 1] ]
		 *
		 * However, this means that for equal length arrays the complexity
		 * of finding a diff would directly go from O(n) to O(n2).
